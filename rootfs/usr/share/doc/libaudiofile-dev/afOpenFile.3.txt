afOpenFile(3)
=============

NAME
----
afOpenFile - open an audio file and create a file handle structure used
for subsequent calls to the Audio File Library

SYNOPSIS
--------
  #include <audiofile.h>

  AFfilehandle afOpenFile(const char *path, const char *mode,
      AFfilesetup setup);

PARAMETERS
----------
'path' is the path to the file to be opened.

'mode' specifies a mode for opening the file: `"r"` for reading or
`"w"` for writing.

'setup' is an AFfilesetup created by linkaf:afNewFileSetup[3]. This value
is ignored for files opened for reading except when the file format is
`AF_FILE_RAWDATA`.

RETURN VALUE
------------
Upon success, `afOpenFile` returns a valid `AFfilehandle` which can
be used in subsequent calls to the Audio File Library. Upon failure,
`afOpenFile` returns NULL.

linkaf:afCloseFile[3] is used to close the file when it is no longer
needed.

ERRORS
------
`afOpenFile` can produce the following errors:

`AF_BAD_OPEN`:: open failed
`AF_BAD_READ`:: read failed
`AF_BAD_WRITE`:: write failed
`AF_BAD_LSEEK`:: lseek failed
`AF_BAD_MALLOC`:: memory allocation failed
`AF_BAD_FILEFMT`:: unrecognized file format
