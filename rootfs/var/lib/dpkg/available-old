 Xlib:
 .
  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

Description: report the search path for a class's ISA tree
 Suppose you have a class (like Food::Fish::Fishstick) that is derived, via
 its @ISA, from one or more superclasses (as Food::Fish::Fishstick is from
 Food::Fish, Life::Fungus, and Chemicals), and some of those superclasses may
 themselves each be derived, via its @ISA, from one or more superclasses (as
 above).
 .
 When, then, you call a method in that class ($fishstick->calories), Perl
 first searches there for that method, but if it's not there, it goes
 searching in its superclasses, and so on, in a depth-first (or maybe
 "height-first" is the word) search. In the above example, it'd first look in
 Food::Fish, then Food, then Matter, then Life::Fungus, then Life, then
 Chemicals.
 .
 This library, Class::ISA, provides functions that return that list -- the
 list (in order) of names of classes Perl would search to find a method, with
 no duplicates.

    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
 It can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.
 It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant
 with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC 4880.
 .
 GnuPG 1.4 is the standalone, non-modularized series. In contrast to
 the version 2 series, shipped with the gnupg2 package, it comes
 with no support for S/MIME and some other tools useful for desktop
 environments, but also with less dependencies.
 .
 The gnupg package is built without libcurl. So it does not support
 HKPS keyservers. Install the gnupg-curl package if you want to use
 the keyserver helper tools built with libcurl and supporting HKPS.
 .
 GnuPG does not use any patented algorithms. This means it cannot be
 compatible with PGP2, because that uses IDEA (which is patented in
 a number of countries).

 SASL is the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a method for
 adding authentication support to connection-based protocols. To use
 SASL, a protocol includes a command for identifying and
 authenticating a user to a server and for optionally negotiating
 protection of subsequent protocol interactions. If its use is
 negotiated, a security layer is inserted between the protocol and the
 connection. See RFC 2222 for more information.

 This library provides weak aliases for pthread functions not provided

 single-threaded. libpthread-stubs supports this behavior even on
 platforms which do not supply all the necessary pthread stubs.

 package ships only the pkg-config file pthread-stubs.pc, to allow
 libraries to unconditionally express a dependency on pthread-stubs and
 still obtain correct behavior.

Description: Network Audio System - development files
 The Network Audio System (NAS) was developed by NCD for playing,
 recording, and manipulating audio data over a network. Like the X
 Window System, it uses the client/server model to separate
 applications from the specific drivers that control audio input and
 output devices.
 .
 This package contains the header files and static library (libaudio.a),
 needed for development of programs using NAS.

Description: Library of various useful C++ code
 libwibble collects the foundation code that has been used over time
 in various C++ projects by Peter Rockai and Enrico Zini, so that it can
 be maintained properly and in a single place.
 .
 The code has minimal dependencies, a test suite, and can be used either as an
 external library or embedded in projects based on either cmake or autotools.
 .
 The library contains:
  * an exception hierarchy;
  * various useful mixin classes;
  * shortcuts for set operations;
  * a featureful self-documenting commandline parser that also supports
    cvs/svn-style subcommands;
  * two different unit-testing system, a tut-based and a custom one;
  * a non-intrusive polymorphic envelope;
  * a logging system;
  * string functions, like splitting, path manipulation, regular
    expressions and word wrapping;
  * system functions, like directory iteration, file manipulation, process
    control, thread functions;
  * gregorian calendar operations.

Description: Tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles
 Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from

 The goal of Automake is to remove the burden of Makefile maintenance
 from the back of the individual GNU maintainer (and put it on the back
 of the Automake maintainer).
 .
 The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of `make' macro definitions
 (with rules being thrown in occasionally).  The generated
 `Makefile.in's are compliant with the GNU Makefile standards.
 .
 Automake 1.11 fails to work in a number of situations that Automake
 1.4, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9 and 1.10 did, so has been renamed so that the
 previous version can continue to be made available.

Description: small, friendly text editor inspired by Pico
 GNU nano is an easy-to-use text editor originally designed as a replacement
 for Pico, the ncurses-based editor from the non-free mailer package Pine
 (itself now available under the Apache License as Alpine).
 .
 However, nano also implements many features missing in pico, including:
  - feature toggles;
  - interactive search and replace (with regular expression support);
  - go to line (and column) command;
  - auto-indentation and color syntax-highlighting;
  - filename tab-completion and support for multiple buffers;
  - full internationalization support.

Description: low level cryptographic library (symmetric and one-way cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GnuPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic
 algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the
 asymmetric cryptos reside in a separate library, libhogweed.
